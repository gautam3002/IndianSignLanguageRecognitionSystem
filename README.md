Features
- Real-time detection of ISL signs using webcam.
- Support for a wide range of ISL signs, including alphabet letters and digits.
- User-friendly interface for intuitive interaction.

 Dataset
We created our own dataset consisting of images of hand gestures representing various ISL signs. The dataset includes samples for each alphabet letter and digit in Indian Sign Language. The dataset was labeled manually to train the machine learning model.

 Algorithm
We used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the primary algorithm for training the ISL sign detection model. CNNs are well-suited for image recognition tasks and have been widely used in computer vision applications. The model was trained on the custom dataset to learn the patterns and features associated with different ISL signs.
